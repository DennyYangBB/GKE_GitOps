== 1. Why GitOps

GitOps brings consistency, traceability, and automation to infrastructure and application deployments.
By treating everything as code and automating changes via pull requests, it improves reliability and operational efficiency.

== 2. Prepare GCP Environment (Required)

GitHub Actions require access to GCP resources for Terraform and deployment automation.
Necessary steps include (link:docs/gcp.adoc[Detail]):

* Create a GCP Project.
* Create a bucket.
* Enable required APIs (e.g., Compute Engine API, Kubernetes Engine API, Artifact Registry API).
* Create Service Account with necessary permissions and generate a JSON key for GitHub Actions.
* Store the key securely in GitHub Secrets.

== 3. Prepare Terraform Environment (Optional)

Although Terraform can be installed locally, in this project GitHub Actions will run Terraform remotely.
However, to troubleshoot or test locally, you can:

* Install Terraform CLI.
* Authenticate to GCP via `gcloud auth application-default login`.

[NOTE]
====
You can refer to the actual implementation in the GitHub Actions workflows.

== 4. Terraform GitOps

. Why Terraform GitOps
* Applying GitOps practices to Terraform provides infrastructure as code with full audit trails, controlled deployments, and the ability to review changes before applying them.
. Steps Explanation: Each module is separated into different stages and commits to minimize risk and facilitate review:
* `01_gke_network`: Set up VPC, subnets, and related networking.
* `02_registry`: Create Artifact Registry for container images.
* `03_gke`: Provision GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) cluster.
* `04_cloud_armor`: Set up Cloud Armor security policies.
. Environment Overview
* `alpha`: Automatically deploys on each commit to test Terraform changes early and catch misconfigurations.
* `production`: Deploys during merge requests to decouple from application CI/CD and ensure review before apply.

[NOTE]
====
In real-world scenarios:

. Lightweight promotion architectures.
. Strict review and approval mechanisms.
====

== 5. Kustomize Manifest GitOps

. Why Kustomize
* Kustomize allows declarative management of Kubernetes manifests without template engines, supporting clean separation of environment-specific configurations.
. Why GitOps
* Storing manifests in Git ensures that cluster state is auditable and reproducible, with pull request workflows for deployments.
. Environment Overview
* `alpha`: High commit frequency; manual deployments help reduce unnecessary noise.
* `beta`: Also uses manual deployments due to ongoing active development.
* `staging`: CI runs on merge requests; deployment triggered on merge.
* `production`: CI/CD is triggered only upon merging to main.

== 6. Furthermore: How to Improve

Possible improvements include:

* Automated security scanning is integrated using https://aquasecurity.github.io/tfsec/latest/[tfsec], https://github.com/open-policy-agent/conftest[conftest].
* Policy as Code is adopted via https://www.checkov.io/[checkov].
* Set up GitOps monitoring and alerting.
* Implement drift detection for infrastructure.
* Suggestion in real world:
1. Lightweight promotion architectures should be designed to ensure scalability and flexibility.
2. Strict review and approval mechanisms should be established to ensure reliability and avoid errors.

== 7. Related Work

If you are interested in Kubernetes observability, I also wrote an article about building observability with Istio.
This demonstrates how to integrate telemetry, tracing, and monitoring into Kubernetes environments.
